# Huddle Multisection Landing Page
This is a basic landing page for a fictional **Community Building** company 
<br>
This is a next level of simple Huddle Landing page that I did last time.
I used Sass instead of CSS because Sass provides some super natural powers that makes the whole project absolute DRY and Awesome!
So I would love to listen to any feedback given and I hope that my code will be useful for the Learners.

Perfect for Screen width 1440px, 1024px, 640px, 375px and 320px
